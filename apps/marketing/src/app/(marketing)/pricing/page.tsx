              How does digital signing work?
            </AccordionTrigger>

            <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground max-w-prose text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Digital signing utilizes cryptographic technology to create a unique digital signature
              for a document. This signature is generated using a private key that is securely
              stored and associated with your identity. When the document is signed, the signature
              is encrypted and embedded within the document. Verification of the digital signature
              confirms the document's integrity and authenticity, ensuring that any tampering or
              modifications can be detected.
